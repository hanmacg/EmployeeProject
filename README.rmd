# Purpose

This is my data cleaning for my machine learning project on employee attrition.


```{r}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(tidyverse)
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
```

First I read in the data
```{r}
employeedat <- read.csv("C:/Users/hanna/OneDrive/Documents/Economics Masters/Data Science/Machine learning/data/Employee.csv")
head(employeedat)
tab <- employeedat %>% select(Education, Age, Gender, LeaveOrNot)
as_tibble(tab)
```

Next I do some cleaning as many of the variables are characters/categorical

```{r}
#create a binary variable for gender - female is 0 and male is 1
employeedat <- employeedat %>%
  mutate(gender_numeric = ifelse(Gender == "Female", 0, 1))
#create a binary variable for ever-benched - i.e., they kept out of projects for a month or more
employeedat <- employeedat %>%
  mutate(benched_numeric = ifelse(EverBenched == "No", 0, 1))
#create a variable for education category where Bachelors =0, Master's =1 and PhD = 2
employeedat <- employeedat %>%
  mutate(education_numeric = case_when(
    Education == "Bachelors" ~ 0,
    Education == "Masters" ~ 1,
    Education == "PHD" ~ 2
  ))

#How many PHD individuals?
phd_count <- sum(employeedat$Education == "PHD")

#create binary variables for whether a person is from Bangalore, Pune or New Delhi
employeedat <- employeedat %>%
  mutate(bangalore = ifelse(City == "Bangalore", 1, 0)) %>% 
    mutate(pune = ifelse(City == "Pune", 1, 0)) %>% 
    mutate(new_delhi = ifelse(City == "New Delhi", 1, 0))


```
